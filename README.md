# Creating a Geospatial Map of Light Attenuation from Suspended Sediment Plumes
#### Department of Life Sciences, Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi


<details><summary>OVERVIEW</summary>
<p>

[Description]

Sediment plumes are generated from both natural and anthropogenic causes, increasing water turbidity and attenuating light that penetrates the water column. Spatial maps facilitate understanding how different suspended sediment disturbances propagate and attenuate light that consequently affects available seagrass. The project aims to develop code to make HOBO light logger data files readable in RStudio to enable spatiotemporal data analysis as a result, creating a spatial map of light attenuation intensity across the seagrass study site.
